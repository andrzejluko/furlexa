# Furlexa Automated Startup
Several scripts I had to write to get a Raspberry PI powered alexa functional in a headless setup. 

When building the Furlexa, online instructions were very limited and I had a difficult time following them, so I decided to just write my own scripts based on my limited bash knowledge. Although I was able to follow the basic directions for getting the Alexa set up, when it came to a headless startup that would automatically run is when the problems came along. There are three commands you have to run to generate a token and start the WakeWordAgent that allows the Furlexa/Alexa to hear you. 

Admittedly I am no expert, and this is just the result of my tinkering. I am sharing this because I couldn't find the answers I was looking for on forums, so I had to create my own. Hopefully someone else that was in the same position as me finds this and it helps them. 

I'm new at using github (I've had the account for awhile but honestly I don't know what I'm doing). If someone actually sees this and has a question or wants some help, I'll try my best.

Thanks!
